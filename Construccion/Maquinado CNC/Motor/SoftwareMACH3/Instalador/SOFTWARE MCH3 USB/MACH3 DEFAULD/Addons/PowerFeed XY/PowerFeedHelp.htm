<title>Help For Power Feed Wizard</title>
<h1>Help for Power Feed</h1>
<p>
This is a simple wizard to emulate a mechanical power feed for a mill, It supports both
X and Y axis feeds, and it can feed at two speeds. It also has the ability to make an
 incremental move in either azis. 
<p>
<B>Feed DRO</b> sets the feed rate for all Feed level moves. When the wizard starts It 
will be set to the feed you last used in any Gcode. You may change the DRO at any time,
 remember to hit ENTER key to save your value. Feed will remain set until you change it.
<p>
<b>Z for Rapid Move</b> Set a value here, and click the 'Z up for Rapid Move' button
and any rapid move will first raise Z to this value, make the rapid move, then return 
Z to its previous value. Use this for operations like facing off stock where you want 
the tool up on return travels.

<p>
<b>Jog on/off </b> This button will toggle the jog keys on or off. When the LED is on
 you may use the arrow keys as normal for jogs.
<p>
<b>Limit DROs</b> There is a 'limit switch' for a Positive and Negative value on each
Axis. When the wizard starts these are all set to zero. You must change at leat one of 
them before the wizard can make a useful move. They do not need to be Positive and
 Negative values, as long as the 
negative limit is less than the positive limit. You could have Xpos=3 and Xneg=1 to
move back and forth between these limits.
<p>
For each direction move there are 2 buttons, a Feed and a Rapid. As their names suggest,
the feed Button will move at the feed rate set by the Feed DRO. The rapid speed is
deterined by your motor tunings. Raid is simply a G00 move.
<p>
<b>Feed Hold</b> as in normal Mach opertions pressing the space bar will cause a feedhold.
To resume moving press whatever feed button you want to move.
<p>
<b>Incremental Moves</b> If you want to make one time, incremental moves you can set 
the DRO in the lower right corner
and press one of the step buttons. This might be used for stepping over one cutter width
if you were doing a surfacing operation on some stock. You could set the Y Incremental 
Step Over value to just less than the tool diameter, then one click of the Y step 
button would move the tool over for the next pass. Note this value can be either a 
positive or negative number, so setting
a Z increment of a negative value would cause Z to step down.
