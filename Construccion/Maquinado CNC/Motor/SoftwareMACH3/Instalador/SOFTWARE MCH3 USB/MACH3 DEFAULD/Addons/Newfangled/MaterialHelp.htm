<h1>Material Selection for Newfangled Wizards</h1>
<p>
The material data is stored in a file, Material.txt, which must be placed in the same
 folder as the wizard screen file- usually C:\Mach3\Addons\Newfangled\Material.txt

<p>
The file is a simple text file, each line contains one material with 4 cutting speed
The speeds are listed in the order of HSS, HSStin, Carbide, Carbidetin. The numbers
 listed are the desired cutting speed in surface feet per minute.

<p>
You may add to this file any special materials you use, and you may adjust the
values to suit your machine.
<p>
<b> Be careful to maintain the file format, the wizard will get confused
if you mess up his files!</b>
<p>
Here is the default Materials.txt file
