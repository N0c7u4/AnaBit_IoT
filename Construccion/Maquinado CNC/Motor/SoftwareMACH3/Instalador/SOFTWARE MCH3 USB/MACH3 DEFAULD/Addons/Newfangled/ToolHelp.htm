<title>Tool Property Screen</title>
<h1>Help for Tool property screen</h1>
This screen sets up all the properties related to the tool. This includes the
feed and spindle speed.
<p>
It is important that all relevant data be entered. If you change a tool diameter, but
do not update the chip load and spindle speed then the old value will be used
for the next operation. This may not be a good idea!
<p>
Note that some values are dependet on others, for example the Feed rate calculation
 depends on the Cutting tip count and the chip load. You should enter the values in 
this screen in the order indicated, from top of screen to the bottom.
<p>
<h2>Tool Selection</h2>
If you do not use Machs tool table then simply leave the tool number a Zero and
enter a tool diameter. 

<p>
If you have a tool table you may select a tool from it by
pressing the "Select Tool from Table" button. This will pop up a list box from which
you amy select a tool. When you make the selection the tool diameter and number
will be placed in the appropriate DRO on the tool property screen.

<p>
<h2>Select Surface Speed</h2>
The Surface Speed is based on the material selected in the first screen, and the tool type
selected here. This wizard uses a Material table that is explained on the material screen. 
For each material type a suitable surface speed for each tool type is listed. If you wish to use
these standard speeds simply select the tool material by one of the 4 buttons.
<p>
If you are using a special tool, or simply want to enter your own surface speed it may be 
entered in the DRO. Be sure to select the correct units.
<p>
<h2>Number of Cutting Tips</h2>
Next, enter the number of cutting tips, of flutes, your tool has.
<p>
<h2>Chip Load</h2>
Chip load is the ammount of material removed by each tip as it rotates through the work.
If you click the "Calc Chip Load" button a chip load value will be calculated based
on the size of tool you selected. You may also enter a chip load value directly in the DRO.
<p>
<h2>Speed and Feed</h2>
Next a spindle speed and feed rate must either be calculated or entered in the DROs. As
with chip load the wizard will calculate these speeds if you press the "Calculate Speed and Feed"
button. Note this calculation depends on the tool diameter and chip load selected, so it is important
that you enter those values before calculating speed and feed.
<p>
<h2>Overrides</h2>
You may enter an override percent for spindle speed, feed rate, or for plunge rate in
the appropriate DROs. Most commonly a plunge override will be set since most tools
must be plunged down in Z slower than they will cut in normal X,Y movement.
<p>
<h2>Other settings</h2>
You must also select a spindle direction, and optionally select coolant or flood.
<p>
The tool properties selected in this screen will be used for the next operation.
